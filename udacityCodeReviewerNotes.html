    <h1>Notes on Becoming a Udacity Code Reviewer Course</h1>
    <h2>Revision Process</h2>
    
    <h3>1 - Read Read Read:</h3>
    <p>All project documentation from Udacity is available in 
    <a href="https://github.com/udacity/Project-Descriptions-for-Review">this 
    GitHub repository</a>. It's necessary to read this information to know all 
    project specification.</p>
    <p>Next step is to read documentation sent from the student.</p>
    
    <h3>2 - Scan and Run:</h3>
    <p>First step is to scan student code to see how it is structured.</p>
    <p>Next step is to run the program to see if it works as expected.</p>
    
    <h3>3 - Provide Review:</h3>
    <p>Two ways of revision:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Code review</strong>: line-by-line commentary on the code, highlighting what about it is awesome and what can be improved.</li>
      <li><strong>Project review</strong>: use each project grading criteria 
        and classify the project items where it Exceeds Specifications, Meets Specifications or Does Not Meet Specifications.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    
    
    <h2>SPECS ideas</h2>
    <h3>Simplify Code</h3>
    <p>It must be analyzed if the student code can be simplified somehow.</p>
    
    <h3>Practice Kindness</h3>
    <p>It's important to remember that a student took hours of his life 
    watching the videos and preparing the projects. So, any effort to reduce frustration must be taken. One way to do so is to be kind with them.</p> 
    <p>In each revision, the revisor must find some characteristics of the code 
    to mark as "Awesome".</p>
    
    <h3>Explain Why &amp; With Examples</h3>
    <p>Each time a correction is done, it's necessary to explain why, 
    preferably pointing to documentation like Google Guides or Python Library 
    Docs, for example. The revisor can also write some code examples to the 
    student. Gist is a good place to put these examples.</p>
    
    <h3>Connect Learners</h3>
    <p>Suggest to the student some useful source of knowledge like Tweeter, 
    e-mail groups, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Style Consistently</h3>
    <p>The student can use any style he wishes (eg: Python Style Guide), but 
    the chosen style must be used throughout all the code.</p>
    <br>
    
    
    <h2>Revision Examples</h2>
    <h3>Stelar revision examples indicated by Kunal:</h3>
    <p>Use these two examples as a guide:</p>
    <ol>
